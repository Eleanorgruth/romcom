# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
We were given a website without functionality, by writing JavaScript we were able to add the following features.
- Generate random romance novel cover when clicking the Show New Random Cover button
- Ability to save a cover, store it in the View Saved Covers section, and delete the cover if needed
- Ability to make your own cover by filling in a form with specified fields
- Seamlessly navigate between all views using the navigation buttons
Now users can generate a random romance novel cover, create their own and save their favorite covers.
### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
## Set Up
1. Fork the `romcom` repository
2. Clone down your new, forked repo
3. In the terminal cd into the repository
4. Open it in your text editor to view our code
5. View the project in the browser by running open index.html in your terminal

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This is the first paired project of the Turing Front End Software Development program. We are on week two of the program. We were given five days to complete the project, and spent roughly 20 hours doing paired programming/collaborating over Zoom.  

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)
This project was completed by Eleanor Ruth and Ryan Nagel.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The learning goals for this project include:
* Write clean, DRY JavaScript
  - Use a provided class by creating object instances using the new keyword
  - Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
* Explore the connection between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
  - Practice reading, understanding, and using provided code
* Write code collaboratively
  - Document changes with atomic commits & thorough code reviews
  - Communicate, troubleshoot, and plan effectively as a team

- We wrote our code using Atom text-editor, and pushed branches up to GitHub using the the Terminal. This was our first time using GitHub to work collaboratively, reviewing code and approving pull requests.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
* Wins:
  - The website is fully functioning without bugs according to the assignment.
  - We worked together throughout the whole process utilizing paired programming and pseudocoding.
* Challenges:
  - Going into this project we had very little knowledge on CSS, HTML and the DOM. Throughout various challenges we troubleshot by using `console.log`, Dev Tools, testing different ideas/logic. We were also able to recognize when we hit a point of unproductive struggle and then reached out to classmates, googled, and reached out to mentors. After completing this project we have a much better understanding of the functionality of frontend development.
